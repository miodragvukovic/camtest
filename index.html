          <h2 class="text-light">Swedish Massage</h2>
          <p class="text-light">Considered the classic, Swedish combines an array of strokes such as rolling, kneading, percussion along with smooth, gliding strokes to improve circulation and comfortably soothe away aches. Pressure ranges from light to moderate. The benefits of this type of bodywork are wide-ranging and can include decreased stress levels, enhanced mental clarity, higher SAT scores, (why not?) and greater flexibility. Recommended for clients who are looking for the total relaxing, feel good massage experience.</p>

          <h2 class="text-light">Deep Tissue Massage</h2>
          <p class="text-light">With deep-tissue massage, we work slowly and deeply into the muscles, to break up adhesions (knots), scar tissue and tightness. We use a variety of techniques to target the muscles that cause pain and tension, relieving and releasing muscle spasms. Always included with the deeper work is a lighter, relaxing touch to help the body relax and let go. Deep tissue is excellent for any chronic pain; from those who engage in heavy physical activity to patients who have chronic muscle tension or sustained physical injury.</p>

          <h2 class="text-light">Myofascial Release</h2>
          <p class="text-light">The word “myofascial” comes from the Latin words “myo” meaning muscle and “fascia” meaning fibrous bands. Fascia is a connective tissue that surrounds all muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and organs within the body. Fascia itself is very strong, flexible, and dynamic, and it responds well to stretching. We’ll use a variety of techniques, including deep and subtle touch, stretching, and movement (“unwinding”) to release chronic holding patterns in the muscular and fascia systems to eliminate pain and facilitate opening. It’s also helpful in treating back and neck pain, headaches, recurring sports injuries, and scoliosis, among other conditions.</p>

We choose blends based on your condition, for example, stress, lethargy, depression, hyperactivity, poor concentration, detoxification, digestive issues, or dry delicate skin.</p>
          <p class="text-light">Essential oils combined with coconut oil nourish the skin, eliminate toxins, and strengthen the immune system. The therapeutic oils are for you to take home with you after treatment (a bonus!)</p>

          <p class="text-light">Used wisely over the months of pregnancy, this massage technique not only helps a mother to relax, it helps ease her into becoming a new mom. It releases the tension built up by the changes in the body, along with soothing anxiety that may come about from a growing baby and the birthing process. Massage can help you feel at home, trust your body, gain empowerment, and encourage you during the months leading up to giving birth.</p>

Restorative practice invites deep muscular release, calms the nervous system, connecting mind and body to reveal the answers that lie within ourselves. Better sleep, better digestion, improved mood, better immune function… the list goes on!</p>

          <p class="text-light">Combine core strength and balance to completely stretch and change your body. In a mobility session our favorite tools are foam rollers, yoga tune up balls, therabands and other massage implements. We mix yoga contact work, assisted stretching, and Yoga Tune Up® ball work to better body alignment. You will emerge feeling balanced, elongated, and relaxed. Please wear yoga or loose-fitting, comfortable clothing for this session.</p>
          <p class="text-light">What is mobility?<br>You gotta move! Stretching and mobility are the parts of a fitness regimen most often skipped and misunderstood. Simple warm up drills help mobility but they don’t go far enough. Stretching only focuses on lengthening short and tight muscles. Mobility work, on the other hand, is a movement-based integrated full-body approach that addresses all the elements that limit movement and performance.</p>

The Yoga Tune Up® Therapy balls provide trigger point therapy by using specially designed high grip rubber balls with focused movement to penetrate through tight layers of fascia and muscle. No matter what physical discipline you teach or practice (or don’t practice, it can be enormously helpful to those whose bodies are in agony from being sitting at a desk!), Yoga Tune Up® can create radical change in your body.</p>

        <div class="col-50">
          <p>After a series of surgeries which led to scar tissue build-up and tendonitis, Ben started working with me. I was ready to go back to Boston to “face the music” and potentially have more surgery to reduce the scar tissue. Of course, I was reluctant to do that! After one session with Ben, I cancelled my appointment in Boston and set up weekly visits. Ben has helped me so much bringing deep release and lasting realignment. I am still seeing Ben regularly but have no plans to head to Boston anytime soon! Ben is kind, courteous, listens well, is very professional, and has a wonderful demeanor for bodywork.</p>

        <div class="col-50">
          <p>Bridget’s vast anatomy knowledge and variety of bodywork skills, bring to her massage work a deep respect for each client’s therapeutic needs and ensures unique, individualized attention at each session. Her auxiliary skills of time management and business acumen make scheduling appointments easy and timely. It is always a healing experience and a personal pleasure to be part of Bridget’s Bodylab practice and a sheer privilege to be on her table as the recipient of her “massage magic.”</p>

        <div class="col-50">
          <p>It wasn’t until I started working with Bridget that my body truly woke up … My flexibility has steadily increased, my balance and posture are better than they have been in years, and I no longer dread getting out of bed in the morning, wondering what new ache or pain awaits me when I hit the floor.</p>
          <p>In short, my physical world is very different now … Mostly what I feel at the end of a session is a sense of exhilaration. I simply can’t imagine a time when I wouldn’t want to be doing this.</p>
          <p>—Peter</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-50">
          <p>I drove up to Great Barrington this past Sunday from NYC to hike. After a full morning of active hiking, I made a spontaneous decision to look for a massage and relax in town. Body Lab took me in with just a 10-minute notice, and I was already happy enough, not expecting to get a top-class massage so far out from the City. Was I thrilled to be proven wrong! Bridget listened to my problems intently and worked on my back with strength, precision, and accuracy. She is clearly a highly trained and experienced professional, being able to address the trigger points on my legs and back with ease (I’m a marathon runner who sits in front of a computer all the time). Highly recommended.</p>
